        <p>This application is designed to show potential arbitrage opportunities for books on eBay and Amazon.
            For example, a book that is sold cheaper on Amazon compared to eBay, might lead to profit if the book is bought on  Amazon
            and sold on eBay. However, this might not be the case! Extra fees such as those levied by the platform, or
            those needed for postage, can eat into any potential profits. This application takes into account all of
            these fees and costs, in order to help you make a profit.
            See the recommended book arbitrage opportunities on the "Opportunities" tab!
        </p>

          <p>Although this application reduces the time input required to find potential arbitrage opportunities, some due diligence by the user is required to verify opportunities. This creator of this software bears no responsibility for any actions carried out by users of this software.</p>
